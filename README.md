#Elevator Occupancy Counter Using ESP-32

Elevator congestion is a frequent challenge in high-traffic buildings(like colleges, offices etc) , where users often find elevators arriving fully occupied, leading to unnecessary delays and frustration. To tackle this issue, I have developed an advanced Elevator Occupancy Counter system using the ESP-32 microcontroller. This system provides real-time monitoring and reporting of elevator capacity.

The ESP-32-based solution uses sensors to accurately count the number of people entering and exiting the elevator. The data is processed in real-time and displayed on a screen in the elevator lobby, allowing waiting users to assess the current occupancy levels. This enables them to decide whether to board the elevator or opt for another one, significantly improving the flow and efficiency of elevator usage.

By offering immediate visibility into elevator capacity, the system optimizes the user experience, reducing wait times, preventing overcrowding, and promoting smarter decision-making during peak hours. Designed with scalability in mind, the system can be easily integrated into both new and existing elevator infrastructures, offering a flexible solution to enhance vertical transportation in modern buildings.
